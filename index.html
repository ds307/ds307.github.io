<p><b>GUIDELINES</b>:
Students are expected to adhere to the <b><abbr title="Duke Community Standard">DCS</abbr></b>. If a student is responsible for
academic dishonesty on a graded item in this course, then the student will have an opportunity to
admit the infraction and, if approved by the Office of Student Conduct, resolve it directly
through a faculty-student resolution agreement; the terms of that agreement would then dictate
the consequences. <br>If the student is found responsible through the Office of Student Conduct and
the infraction is not resolved by a faculty-student resolution agreement, then the student will
receive a <del>passing</del> <ins>failing</ins> grade for the final grade in the course.</p>
