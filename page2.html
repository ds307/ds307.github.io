<p><b>Landscape with the Fall of Icarus</b><blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_with_the_Fall_of_Icarus"> is a painting in oil on canvas measuring 73.5 by 112 centimetres (28.9 in × 44.1 in) in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. It was long thought to be by the leading painter of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, Pieter Bruegel the Elder. However, following technical examinations in 1996 of the painting hanging in the Brussels museum that attribution is regarded as very doubtful, and the painting, perhaps painted in the 1560s, is now usually seen as a good early copy by an unknown artist of Bruegel's lost original, perhaps from about 1558. According to the museum: "It is doubtful the execution is by Breugel the Elder, but the composition can be said with certainty to be his", although recent technical research has re-opened the question.</blockquote></p><br>

<p><b>The Massacre of the Innocents</b><blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents"> is the biblical account of infanticide by Herod the Great, the Roman-appointed King of the Jews. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Herod ordered the execution of all young male children in the vicinity of Bethlehem, so as to avoid the loss of his throne to a newborn King of the Jews whose birth had been announced to him by the Magi. In typical Matthean style, it is understood as the fulfillment of an Old Testament prophecy: <i>"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because her children are no more.'"</i> The number of infants killed is not stated. The Holy Innocents, although Jewish, have been claimed as martyrs for Christianity.</blockquote></p><br>

<h5>-W H Auden</h5>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden" target="_blank">W H Auden - <sup>Wiki</sup></a>
      <p> About suffering they were never wrong,<br>
        The old Masters: how well they understood<br>
        Its human position: how it takes place<br>
        While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully 
        along;<br>
        How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting<br>
        For the miraculous birth, there always must be<br>
        Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating<br>
        On a pond at the edge of the wood:<br>
        They never forgot<br>
        That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course<br>
        Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot<br>
        Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse<br>
        Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.<p>

      <p>In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away<br>
        Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may<br>
        Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,<br>
        But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone<br>
        As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green<br>
        Water, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen<br>
        Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,<br>
        Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.
